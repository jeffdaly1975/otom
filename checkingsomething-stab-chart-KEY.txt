KEY:
? means not sure if this exists
* means we have seen this isotope as an intermediate which then decayed or was stable
! means we saw a reaction attempt this but it either didn't work at all or the isotopes did basic decay
& means we have no inputs which add up to this so it isn't even accessible

So *T-20‚Åª means it should exist if we can just find a route to it
